Phaser + TACO game template / skeleton (VS2015 solution)

A simple template created with Visual Studio 2015 created as a new Blank App (Apache Cordova) TypeScript.

To this, basic Phaser functionality has been added with the addition of some states to serve as a starting point for common 2D cross-platform mobile games. Addition has been made using Bower by adding a dependency of the latest release of Phaser to bower.json and right-clicking Dependencies and selecting Restore packages.
